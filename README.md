# This is the template code for the KnockKnock Web App Startup Project!
Created by Tammy Bajek, Alex Montchik, Patrick Rao, Sarayu Suresh, and Jessica Pei, this app is developed using the Flask framework and is hosted using an Nginx server on an AWS EC2 instance. Every different functionality and unique method was collaborated on and created by different members of the team. All secret information, such as API keys, personal information, etc. has been hidden. Feel free to look around and reach out to any of us with any questions!
